go2:
    go C(C(A))
    d C(U)
nested_go2:
    go C(C(U))
    go2 C(C(U))
    d C(U)
    n C(U)
d0 (go 2 would be bad):
    go C(U)
    d U
go2 (in case crut):
    go C(C(U))
    d C(U)
go2 (in function call):
    go C(C(U))
    d C(U)
go2 (using surrounding interesting let):
    go C(C(U))
    d C(U)
    n C(U)
go2 (using surrounding boring let):
    go C(C(U))
    d C(U)
    z U
two calls, one from let and from body (d 1 would be bad):
    go C(C(U))
    d U
a thunk in a recursion (d 1 would be bad):
    d U
    n U
two thunks, one called multiple times (both arity 1 would be bad!):
    d U
    n C(U)
two functions, not thunks:
    go C(C(U))
    go2 C(C(U))
a thunk, called multiple times via a forking recursion (d 1 would be bad!):
    go2 C(C(U))
    d U
a function, one called multiple times via a forking recursion:
    go C(C(U))
    go2 C(C(U))
two functions (recursive):
    go C(C(U))
    go2 C(C(U))
mutual recursion (thunks), called mutiple times (both arity 1 would be bad!):
    d U
    n U
mutual recursion (functions), but no thunks:
    go C(C(U))
    go2 C(C(U))
mutual recursion (functions), one boring (d 1 would be bad):
    go C(C(U))
    go2 C(C(U))
    d U
a thunk (non-function-type), called twice, still calls once:
    x U
    d C(U)
a thunk (function type), called multiple times, still calls once:
    d C(U)
    n U
a thunk (non-function-type), in mutual recursion, still calls once (d 0 would be bad):
    go C(C(U))
    x U
    d C(U)
a thunk (non-function-type), in mutual recursion, causes many calls (d 1 would be bad):
    go C(C(U))
    x U
    d U
a thunk (function type), in mutual recursion, still calls once (d 1 would be good):
    go C(U)
    d C(U)
    n U
a thunk (non-function-type) co-calls with the body (d 1 would be bad):
    x U
    d U
